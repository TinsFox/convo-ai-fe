I totally understand how things can get busy. Thanks for the update. While the original deadline is tight, I can see if we can manage a slight extension. Let me check with the team and see if it's feasible. I'll get back to you shortly. In the meantime, if there's any way you can expedite the process, that would be fantastic. Just keep me posted on your progress. Thanks for your understanding!Remember to adjust the dialogue to match your personal communication style and relationship with the client.
